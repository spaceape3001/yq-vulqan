***NOTICE*** (20 Dec 2025) The ImGui update contains a bug, it'll repeatedly import the textures, and this will eventually run out of VkImageViews and will thus fail.  It'll be fixed next tag.

***UPDATE*** (02 Feb 2025 B) Camera SDK example works again, tagging again

***UPDATE*** (02 Feb 2025) Tagging given the extensive changes
